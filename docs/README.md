# Merge Ahead
Clone of merging blocks in a 4 by 4 grid. Blocks with the same value will combine to form larger blocks. See how high you can build your blocks without running out of room!

HTML div based approach featuring:
* Game state based music: New game, mid game, end of game
* Settings for width (qs param n=?), and which base number to start with (qs param e=?)
* High score
* Konami code causing gradient background
